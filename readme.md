# 👋 Hi, I'm Broly

🚀 **Backend & Systems Developer**  
🎮 **Game Engine / Voxel Engine Enthusiast**  
🧠 **Self-taught programmer focused on fundamentals**

I enjoy building things **from the ground up** — from low-level C/C++ systems to scalable backend architectures.  
My work blends **performance, clean design, and learning-by-building**.

## 🧩 What I’m Working On

- 🧱 **Voxel Engine (C++ / Raylib)**
  - Chunk-based world system
  - Fast chunk meshing & vertex batching
  - ECS-style architecture
  - Rendering optimizations

- 🔐 **Authentication & User Management API**
  - Built with **NestJS + MySQL**
  - JWT authentication
  - Role-based access control
  - Modular, scalable backend design

- 🏢 **Multi-Tenant SaaS Backend**
  - Organization-based data isolation
  - User roles & permissions
  - Designed for scalability

- 🌐 **IRC Server (C++)**
  - Socket-based networking
  - Channel creation & messaging
  - Core written in C++ with layered architecture
